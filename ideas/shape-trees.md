# Shape trees

My ideas surrounding shape trees

* Shape trees require you to map out the tree of shapes from the entire solid pod, in this case, 
  multiple leaves can have the same shapes. Thatâ€™s quite some overhead for a simple search. (TODO: validate claim)
* You can use LDP containers + shape trees to have authentication rules.
  (But maybe you just want to have an adaptive resource that is one file? (or find a balance between a big file and potential multiple request))
