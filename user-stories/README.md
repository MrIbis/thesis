# User stories

We describe the different user stories in [stories.md](stories.md).

After familiarizing yourself with the user stories and understanding the functional requirements,
you can read the evaluation of the different technologies.

### [Solid Specification tools](https://solidproject.org/developers/tools/)
As far as I can tell, all solid specification tools use LDP and WAC for updates.
We evaluate these choices in 
[LDP-WAC.md](LDP-WAC.md).
